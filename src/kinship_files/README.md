`KinInf_abcd_controlledFD.csv`: kinship info of the ABCD discovery set used in ACE modelling. <br/>

`KinInf_abcd_controlledFD&site.csv`: kinship info of the ABCD validation set used in ACE modelling. <br/>

`KinInf_hcp_S1200.csv`: kinship info of the HCP cohort used in ACE modelling. <br/>

`kinship_abcd_controlledFD.mat`: kinship relationship matrix of the ABCD discovery set used in computing spatial correlation between each two participants. `4` denotes MZ twin pairs, `3` denotes DZ twin pairs, `2` denotes sibling pairs, `1` denotes unrelated individual pairs, `0` denotes the participant himself/herself or participants from different site. <br/>

`kinship_abcd_controlledFD&site.mat`: kinship relationship matrix of the ABCD validation set used in computing spatial correlation between each two participants. `4` denotes MZ twin pairs, `3` denotes DZ twin pairs, `2` denotes sibling pairs, `1` denotes unrelated individual pairs, `0` denotes the participant himself/herself or participants from different site. <br/>

`kinship_hcp.mat`: kinship relationship matrix of the HCP cohort used in computing spatial correlation between each two participants. `4` denotes MZ twin pairs, `3` denotes DZ twin pairs, `2` denotes sibling pairs, `1` denotes unrelated individual pairs, `0` denotes the participant himself/herself. <br/>

`SVM_relative_pairs_hcp.mat`: kinship relationships, seperated into 4 categories to simplify computation of the SVM classifier. <br/>
